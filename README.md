# EMF-Assignment-A5-GROUP8
EMF Assignment for Model Driven Engineering at the University Of L'Aquila.

## Assignment Objective
The assignment's objective is to apply model transformations to refine, migrate, and generate outputs based on a metamodel. This involves refining a metamodel by restructuring, renaming, and modifying its elements. It also includes migrating models from the original to the refined metamodel using Model-to-Model (M2M) transformations in ATL and generating HTML outputs using Model-to-Text (M2T) transformations in Acceleo.

## Task Completion Checklist
1. Apply different refractory operations on the metamodel defined in the A4 to create an updated version
